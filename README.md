CubePart is a generative framework for **open-vocabulary, part-controllable** 3D
mesh generation. Given a global text prompt and a user-defined parts schema
(an open-ended list of part names), CubePart synthesizes a set of meshes—one
per schema element—that assemble into a coherent object while respecting the
specified semantic structure. The resulting assets can be directly integrated
into game engines and driven by animation, physics, and behavior scripts
without manual post-processing.

This codebase releases the multi-part mesh decomposition
model, together with its shape VAE and inference scripts. Given any input
mesh and a list of part names, it produces the corresponding per-part meshes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download model weights

The pretrained checkpoints (multi-part DiT + shape VAE) are hosted on the
Hugging Face Hub at [`Roblox/cubepart`](https://huggingface.co/Roblox/cubepart).
Download them into a local `weights/` directory:

```bash
huggingface-cli download Roblox/cubepart --local-dir weights
```

or, equivalently, from Python:

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(repo_id="Roblox/cubepart", local_dir="weights")
```

This produces:

```
weights/
├── multi_part_dit.safetensors    # multi-part DiT (~8.6 GB)
└── vae.safetensors               # shape VAE (~1.3 GB)
```

All examples below assume this `weights/` layout. If you keep the weights
elsewhere, pass the corresponding paths via `--checkpoint` / `--vae-checkpoint`.

## Quick start

### Multi-part decomposition

The parts pipeline takes a pre-encoded shape latent plus a list of part
names and returns one mesh per part. Use `encode_shape` to obtain the
latent from an existing mesh.

```python
import torch
import trimesh

from cube_part.pipelines import PartShapeDenoiserPipeline, ShapeInput
from cube_part.utils.mesh import load_mesh, sample_surface

parts_pipe = PartShapeDenoiserPipeline(
    config_path="configs/shape_denoiser_multimesh.yaml",
    checkpoint_path="weights/multi_part_dit.safetensors",
    vae_checkpoint_path="weights/vae.safetensors",
    extract_geometry_fn_name="extract_geometry_coarse_to_fine",
)

mesh, _, _ = load_mesh("examples/inputs/jellyfish_car.glb")
surface = sample_surface(mesh, num_samples=128_000)
surface = (
    torch.from_numpy(surface).to(parts_pipe.device).unsqueeze(0).float()
)
latents, _ = parts_pipe.encode_shape(surface)

part_meshes = parts_pipe.input_to_part_shape(
    ShapeInput(prompt=[["body", "wheels"]], latents=latents),
    guidance_scale=7.5,
    num_inference_steps=50,
)

for i, (vertices, faces) in enumerate(part_meshes):
    if vertices is not None:
        trimesh.Trimesh(vertices, faces).export(f"part_{i:02d}.glb")
```

A complete, runnable example lives in [`examples/run_inference.py`](examples/run_inference.py).
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.

python examples/run_inference.py \
    --config configs/shape_denoiser_multimesh.yaml \
    --checkpoint weights/multi_part_dit.safetensors \
    --vae-checkpoint weights/vae.safetensors \
    --mesh examples/inputs/jellyfish_car.glb \
    --parts "body, front right wheel, front left wheel, rear right wheel, rear left wheel, exhaust pipe, headlights, gun" \
    --output outputs/jellyfish_car_parts
```

> **Notes:** To get optimal results, please follow the guidelines below:
>
> 1. The input mesh should be **canonically aligned** (+Y up, +Z forward).
> 2. A watertight, single-surface mesh is preferred. Meshes with duplicated inner/outer shells (common in some AI-generated meshes) often degrade quality.

### Gradio demo

A small Gradio UI is provided in [`examples/gradio_demo.py`](examples/gradio_demo.py).
It loads the multi-mesh denoiser once, lets you drag-and-drop a `.glb`, type a
list of part names, and renders the resulting colored part scene with
`gr.Model3D`.

```bash
pip install ".[demo]"   # adds gradio
python examples/gradio_demo.py \
    --config configs/shape_denoiser_multimesh.yaml \
    --checkpoint weights/multi_part_dit.safetensors \
    --vae-checkpoint weights/vae.safetensors
```
